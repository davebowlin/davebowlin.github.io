        <h2>Specific Reasons</h2>
        <p>If I get accepted into the #vetswhocode program for web development, I will learn the 
            languages and techniques to the best of my ability. I intend to be employed in the 
            web development field, and therefore I will be. This opportunity being offered to
             myself and other veterans should not, must not, be wasted. This is a gift being 
             offered freely by other veterans to help us, and we must do our absolute best to learn
             and become employable in this field in order to repay this gift, passing on our own 
             knowledge and experience to the next generation of developers.
        </p>
        <p>My children and grown and have families of their own now. Living alone is a new experience for me, 
            but I am enjoying the free time that I have now. I'm getting close to 50 years old 
            and to stay competitive in my career, I must learn new programming languages and excel in 
            them. Completing the #vetswhocode course will help to ensure that I remain self-sufficient in 
            not only my career, but in my personal life as well. 
        </p>
        <p>Whether I am accepted into the #vetswhocode program or not, I will continue to explore the 
            many opportunities in web development. I do not wish to remain living in Kentucky for many 
            more years, and therefore I need development skills more relevant to real world technology so that 
            I can stay employable, and that path is clearly web development.
        </p>
        <p>Web development is an incredibly lucrative and fast-growing field. I will be among those who work 
            in it, and am anxious to learn and eventually share my experience and knowledge with other veterans
            who want a career in software development.
