        <h2>The basics</h2> 
        <p>My gender is male (perhaps the facial hair and name tipped you off?), and I was born on 3 July 1970. I am
         <em>very happily</em> divorced, and am in a serious relationship with a lovely nurse whom I have known for
          years. I have three daughters and five granddaughters. I've given up on the idea of having a son or grandson,
          and now claim my nephew as my one and only, although he is now grown, and an Embassy Guard in the US Marine
         Corps in Austria.</p>
         <p>I have been recently diagnosed with MS (multiple sclerosis). Although it took me by surprise and has
             brought many changes to my lifestyle, it is also a source of inspiration for me to stay active
             and take better care of myself. Sometimes I have to walk with a cane, sometimes I have to use a wheelchair,
             but always I am grateful for my health, family, and friends.
         </p>
        <p>I am a software developer, and have been for over 30 years. My parents bought me a TRS-80 Color Computer 2, by
            Tandy / Radio Shack, when I was 14 years old, and I've been hooked on coding ever since. That "trash 80" or "coco"
        as it is affectionately known, was a turning point in my life. I started coding from the manual that came with it, and
    I have been writing code ever since. Currently, I am working on a destkop application package for the automotive
 industry, and the software is now in beta testing. I hope to have it in production use within the next six months.</p>
    <p>Some people go through life without working in the field of their passion. I'm blessed to have found mine and
        worked in it for almost all my life. I cannot imagine enjoying a caereer more than software development.</p>
