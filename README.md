Simple website about me

## This is part of the _Vets Who Code_ pre-work

So far, I am learning about:
* Markdown formatting
* [GitHub](www.github.com)
* HTML
* CSS -- _so much to learn!_
* JavaScript
* [Dev.to](www.dev.to)
* [CodePen](www.codepen.io)

I am very excited about learning all of this. There is so much to explore.  
Currently, I am on the **JavaScript** section.  
  
  
This is a very enjoyable experience and I look forward to learning it in depth.
