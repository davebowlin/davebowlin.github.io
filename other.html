            <h2>More random things about me</h2>
        <p>I am a huge fan of the Robert E. Howard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian" style="color: blue">Conan
             the Barbarian</a> novels, stories, and comics. The movies? They're okay, at best. Queue the robotic Arnold voice:  "I'll be back!"
             Douglas Adams is my favorite novelist, although he hitched his way to Heaven years ago. Ford Prefect, Arthur Dent, and Marvin
             have been part of my life for years, and I even have a tattoo of "Mostly Harmless" on my shoulder. Do you know where your
             towel is? If so, you're a hoopy frood, and the Answer is 42.
            </p>
            <p>I have written over 100 short stories and novellas, although the "great American novel" has eluded me thus far.
                Writing short stories to amuse myself is a wonderful way to stay young, creative, and imaginative. Most of them
                have been published at one time or another, mostly online.
            </p>
        <p>I have a book of short stories available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Regurgitated-Nightmares-David-Bowlin/dp/1554040906/" 
            style="color: blue">Amazon</a>, and I was the editor of a collection, available at 
            <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/atrocitas-aqua-david-bowlin/1100068630?ean=2940000065525" style="color: blue">
            Barnes and Nobles</a> online. I have also published several nonfiction pieces as well, online 
             and print, in such magazines as <em>Writer's Digest</em>, <em>Would That It Were</em>, <em>Foxfire Magazine</em>, and
             several newspaper and technical editorials.
        </p>
        <p>I've been playing <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em> since 1993 with family and friends, and I build almost all of the props
            for our sessions myself, using a variety of tools, materials, and techniques I've learned over the years.</p>
        <p>Although I have tried for a few decades now, I still suck at playing the harmonica.</p>
