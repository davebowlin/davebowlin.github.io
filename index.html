        <h1>David Bowlin: A brief introduction</h1>        
        <p>My name is David Bowlin, and I currently live in south-central Kentucky.</p>

        <h2>The basics</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>My gender is male</li>
            <li>Birthdate is 3 July 1970</li>
            <li>Marital status: <em>very happily</em> divorced</li>
            <li>I have three daughters and five granddaughters</li>
            <li>Occupation: software developer</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Some specifics</h2>
        <p>As a new father, I enlisted in the United States Air Force in March 1992. After basic
            training in Texas, I went to Chanute AFB in Illinois. When the training was over, my
            first duty station was in upstate New York. Plattsburg was a very cold place, and
            I had a very hard time adjusting to the large amounts of snow.
        </p>
        <p>After a couple years, Congress decided to close Plattsburg base, and I was sent to
            Fort Walton Beach, Florida, where I was assigned to a special operations unit at
            Hurlburt Field. I spent the next eight years there, although I was sent to many different
            places throughout the world during that time. When I completed my enlistment,
            I discharged from the military, but stayed in Fort Walton Beach with my family.
        </p>
        <p>The difference in climate from Plattsburg and Fort Walton Beach was incredible. We went
            from blizzards and sub-zero temperatures to hurricanes and 100+ degrees, and from
            mountains to beaches. We <em>loved</em> living in Fort Walton Beach.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, we moved back to Kentucky, where my ex-wife and I are originally from, and
            had many experiences. I finished college at Western Kentucky University, and earned
            a degreen in computer information systems, with an emphasis on databases. Unfortuantely,
            the marriage was not salvageable, so we decided to go our separate ways after our
            children were grown.
        </p>
