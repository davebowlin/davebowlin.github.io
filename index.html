        <h1>David Bowlin: A brief introduction</h1>        
        <p>My name is David Bowlin, and I currently live in south-central Kentucky.</p>

        <h2>The basics</h2> 
        <ul>
            <li>My gender is male</li>
            <li>Birthdate is 3 July 1970</li>
            <li>Marital status: <em>very happily</em> divorced</li>
            <li>I have three daughters and five granddaughters</li>
            <li>Occupation: software developer</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Some specifics</h2>
        <p>As a new father, I enlisted in the United States Air Force in March 1992. After basic
            training in Texas, I went to Chanute AFB in Illinois. When the training was over, my
            first duty station was in upstate New York. Plattsburg's temperatures were cold, and
            I had a very hard time adjusting to the large amounts of snow.
        </p>
        <p>After a couple years, Congress decided to close Plattsburg base, and I was sent to
            Fort Walton Beach, Florida, where I was assigned to a special operations unit at
            Hurlburt Field. I spent the next eight years there, although I was sent to many different
            places throughout the world during that time. When I completed my enlistment,
            I discharged from the military, but stayed in Fort Walton Beach with my family.
        </p>
        <p>The difference in climate from Plattsburg and Fort Walton Beach was incredible. We went
            from <strong>blizzards and sub-zero temperatures to hurricanes and 100+ degrees</strong>, and from
            mountains to beaches. We <em>loved</em> living in Fort Walton Beach, but due to some personal issues,
            we decided it would be best to relocate once again.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, we moved back to Kentucky, where my ex-wife and I are originally from. I finished 
            college at Western Kentucky University, and earned a degreen in computer information systems,
             with an emphasis on databases. Unfortuantely, the marriage continued to disintegrate, the kids
             were grown, and so we decided to go our separate ways.
        </p>

             the Barbarian</a> novels, stories, and comics. The movies? They're okay, at best.

        <p>I have a book of short stories available on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Regurgitated-Nightmares-David-Bowlin/dp/1554040906/">Amazon</a>,
            and I was the editor of a collection, available at <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/atrocitas-aqua-david-bowlin/1100068630?ean=2940000065525">
            Barnes and Nobles</a> online. I have also published many other short stories and several nonfiction pieces as well, online

            where I work as systems administrator.
        </p>
        <p>I am very excited to learn web development, as my programming experience up to this point
             has been desktop applications, a few simple games, and database design and maintenance.
