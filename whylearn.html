        <h2>Why Learn Web Development?</h2> 
        <p>Although I have been a developer for more than 20 years, my career has been in desktop development. I currently
            work and live in south-central Kentucky, and have to drive more than 600 miles per week for my job, just getting
            to and from the office. This wouldn't normally be a problem, but I've recently been diagnosed with MS (multiple 
            sclerosis), and that has made driving extremely difficult at times.
        </p>
         <p>My current job requires me to work on-site, and I cover seven counties in Kentucky by myself. I am the sole IT 
             person in the company, which means I wear a lot of hats: software developer, systems administrator, tech support,
             etc. The running joke at work is: "If it plugs in or beeps, it must be Dave's responsibility." Unfortunately, 
             this means that I'm on the road even more.
         </p>
        <p>My parents bought me a TRS-80 Color Computer 2, by Tandy / Radio Shack, when I was 14 years old, and I've been hooked on coding ever since. That "trash 80" or "coco"
        as it is affectionately known, was a turning point in my life. I started coding from the manual that came with it, and
    I have been writing code ever since. With the rise of the Internet and all the following technology, developers for the Web
are in increasingly high demand. As a developer with experience, I am sure that I can learn web programming quickly, and therefore will 
be able to find an employment opportunity better suited to my physical needs.</p>
    <p>Some people go through life doing jobs they despise, or at best don't really enjoy. I'm blessed to have found mine and
        worked in it for almost all my life. I cannot imagine enjoying a career more than software development. Now, it is time for me 
    as a developer to increase my knowledge and expertise with web development.</p>
